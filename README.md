# 100-days-of-code
My 100 Days of Code challenge — daily log and code.


### Day 1: 18 January 2026
- Today I created the repository for my 100 Days of Code challenge.
- Wrote my first simple program (Hello World).
- Learned how to push changes to GitHub.


### Day 2: Python Basics

**What I did:**
- Learned basic Python syntax
- Practiced `print()` statements
- Worked with variables and data types
- Performed arithmetic operations
- Learned type casting (`str`, `int`, `float`)
- Explored lists and unpacking
- Understood local vs global variables

**Files added:**
- `day02/python-intro.md`

**Key Learnings:**
- Python is dynamically typed
- Variables can be reassigned to different data types
- Lists can be unpacked into multiple variables
- Local variables inside functions do not affect global variables


### Day 3 – Python Basics & Data Types

**What I did:**
- Learned basic Python syntax and printing
- Practiced variables and dynamic typing
- Performed arithmetic operations
- Explored Python built-in data types
- Learned about type casting and type checking
- Practiced functions to demonstrate each data type

**File added:**
- `day03/python-data-types.md`

**Key Learnings:**
- Python supports many built-in data types (int, float, str, list, tuple, dict, set, etc.)
- Variables can change type during runtime
- Each data type has specific use cases
- Functions help organize and test different data types
- `type()` is used to identify variable data types


### Day 4 – Python Numbers & Strings

**What I did:**
- Learned Python numeric data types (int, float, complex)
- Worked with scientific notation numbers
- Practiced type conversion between numbers
- Generated random numbers using the `random` module
- Learned Python string basics
- Practiced string indexing, looping, and slicing
- Used common string methods (`upper`, `lower`, `strip`, `replace`, `split`)
- Learned string concatenation and f-strings
- Explored escape characters in strings

**Files added:**
- `day04/python-numbers-random.md`
- `day04/python-strings.md`

**Key Learnings:**
- Python supports multiple numeric types with flexible conversion
- Scientific notation values are treated as floats
- The `random` module helps generate random numbers
- Strings are iterable and support slicing
- String methods simplify text manipulation
- f-strings provide a clean way to format strings


### Day 5 – Python Booleans, Operators & Conditional Statements

**What I did:**
- Learned how Python evaluates truthy and falsy values
- Practiced Boolean expressions using `bool()`
- Worked with arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`, `//`)
- Practiced assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, etc.)
- Learned bitwise assignment operators
- Built a menu-driven program using `if`, `elif`, and `else`
- Compared numbers using equality and greater/lesser conditions

**Files added:**
- `day05/booleans-operators-ifelse.md`

**Key Learnings:**
- Non-empty values evaluate to `True`, empty values evaluate to `False`
- Python supports multiple operator categories
- Assignment operators modify variables in place
- Conditional statements control program flow
- User input can be combined with logic to build interactive programs


### Day 6 – Python Operators

**What I did:**
- Learned comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
- Practiced logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Understood identity operators (`is`, `is not`)
- Worked with bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`)
- Used membership operators (`in`, `not in`)
- Built a small interactive program to check list membership using user input

**Files added:**
- `day06/python-operators.md`

**Key Learnings:**
- Comparison operators return Boolean values
- Logical operators combine multiple conditions
- Identity operators compare memory references, not values
- Bitwise operators work at the binary level
- Membership operators help check existence in collections


### Day 7 – Python Lists & Loops

**What I did:**
- Learned list operations and methods such as `append`, `remove`, `insert`, and `clear`
- Practiced list slicing and indexing
- Explored looping techniques with `for`, `while`, and list comprehensions
- Built interactive programs that filter and modify lists based on conditions
- Learned how to join and copy lists
- Sorted and reversed lists using built-in methods

**Files added:**
- `day07/python-lists-loops.md`

**Key Learnings:**
- Lists are versatile and support various operations for adding, removing, and modifying elements
- Looping through lists with `for`, `while`, and list comprehension simplifies iteration and modification
- List comprehension allows easy filtering and transformation of data
- Lists can be joined using `+` or `extend()`
- `sort()` and `reverse()` allow efficient sorting and reversing of list items
