# 100-days-of-code
My 100 Days of Code challenge — daily log and code.


### Day 1: 18 January 2026
- Today I created the repository for my 100 Days of Code challenge.
- Wrote my first simple program (Hello World).
- Learned how to push changes to GitHub.


### Day 2: Python Basics

**What I did:**
- Learned basic Python syntax
- Practiced `print()` statements
- Worked with variables and data types
- Performed arithmetic operations
- Learned type casting (`str`, `int`, `float`)
- Explored lists and unpacking
- Understood local vs global variables

**Files added:**
- `day02/python-intro.md`

**Key Learnings:**
- Python is dynamically typed
- Variables can be reassigned to different data types
- Lists can be unpacked into multiple variables
- Local variables inside functions do not affect global variables


### Day 3 – Python Basics & Data Types

**What I did:**
- Learned basic Python syntax and printing
- Practiced variables and dynamic typing
- Performed arithmetic operations
- Explored Python built-in data types
- Learned about type casting and type checking
- Practiced functions to demonstrate each data type

**File added:**
- `day03/python-data-types.md`

**Key Learnings:**
- Python supports many built-in data types (int, float, str, list, tuple, dict, set, etc.)
- Variables can change type during runtime
- Each data type has specific use cases
- Functions help organize and test different data types
- `type()` is used to identify variable data types
